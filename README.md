Blood Donation System 

My webiste's purpose is to keep track of donors who share similar blood types, so when specific blood type is required for a patient in need, you can check who is eligible to share their blood. Information such as their full name, contact number and age is kept. You can also view upcoming blood donation events, so that more people could participate and help out. Having the donors information saved speeds up the process of donation as their blood type is already known.

You can add and delete events, donors and blood types. 

The problem i ran into near the end is the edit function. It no longer worked after I added event pages. I couldn't find the problem. 

I used a project that was up on moodle as a guidance of the MVC design.

Requirements:

XAMPP - Apache and MySQL

An IDE, such as NetBeans
